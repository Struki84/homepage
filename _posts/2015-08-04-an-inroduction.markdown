> "Our great war is a spirtual war..."

There is some wisdom in the words of Tyler Durden, althou he just rased the issue, he slowly became a symbol. A symbol of a struggle, a secret battle happenning in each man and in the entire world at the same time. Some would call it war mongin, or terrorisam, but it is only fact. 
Like many others Mr. Durden is representating a fragment of larger issue a war waging for centuries, a war for the mind, body and soul. War fought without bullets or bayonets, bit still with a token of blood.


Capitalsm is a great idea, but the problem is the wotld is not big enough. But imagine if we could have a place where resiurces would be infinte, no constictions of space time, no boundiers for expantion, imagne if if such a plce existed. We'll what do you know, such a place does exosts, we call it the universe.
