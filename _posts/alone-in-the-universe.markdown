### Alone in the Universe

- each person sees the unverse as a spehere of light stretchin in every direction for 14 billion ly
- each person is seeing a differante universe based on his relative POV
- we see tha "same" unvierse only if we are moving at the same relative speed ass our counterpart observer 
- on macro lvl we interact with each other trough sound waves and EM waves, chemcal interactions,  and â€œphysical contact"
- on micro lvl it is imposible to have a "physical contact" with another person, or with any other mater for that fact. We interact with our magentic fileds. sorta
- dargons are real, they populated the earth around 60 million years ago. Same thing it is true for multiverse. it is Real as a it manifest from each of specific POV of the continuous concusness that is set at the "center" of the universe and it is serving as a quantum "center" from witch all measurments and quantum interactions are made from


To all who pursue knowledge, they should be a warned about the cruse that lies beneath. By widening of your senses with use of reason, empirical data, and observation, by tuning your intuition to what was intuitive before, you shatter the walls of illusion around you. Your perception is indefinitely changed in your pursuit to learn, and as such your illusions of mortality, immortality, god, religion, life, yourself are broken, like cheap glass. 

After demolishing all those walls you will find your self alone, not many can break those barriers and to some they are impenetrable. As you gaze trough unknown far beyond the shores of human knowledge, in your solace you may rarely find a single one as you. As in cosmic collisions if such people collide at high velocities far beyond of borders whats normal, you stand in awe of the destructive force of the collision, only to be blown away when it is surpassed by the creative force that is born a millisecond later.
