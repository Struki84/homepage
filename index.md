My name is Simun Strukan. I'm a mechanical and software engineer based in Zagreb, Croatia. 

I used to pretend I was writing a blog, but I'm too lazy to do it, so I've given up.

I do [write code](https://github.com/Struki84) and occasionally contribute to open-source projects. 

I also have entrepreneurial experience as the former founder of Sintezis Startup Studio. 

Currently, I'm focused on practical AI applications and have founded Astro Synapse, an AI Research and Integrations Lab.
